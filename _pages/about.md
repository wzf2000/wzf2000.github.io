I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science and Technology at Tsinghua University, advised by Prof. [Min Zhang](http://www.thuir.cn/group/~mzhang/). My research interests include **recommender systems**, **natural language processing**, and **large language models**.

I received my B.S. degree from the Department of Computer Science and Technology at Tsinghua University in 2023. I am a member of the [Information Retrieval Lab at Tsinghua University (THUIR)](http://www.thuir.cn/).
