The project is a course project for _Advanced Information Retrieval_ course, 2024 Spring in Tsinghua University.
The project is a music crawler that can crawl concerts information from the Internet and provide a search engine for users to search for concerts information.
I worked with [Yuanqing Yu](https://yuyq18.github.io/) to complete this course project.

The project is now running on [here](https://music.wzf2000.top).
And the source code of the frontend is available on GitHub:

- [Frontend repository](https://github.com/wzf2000/IR-music)
<!-- - [Crawler repository](https://github.com/yuyq18/Music-Crawler) -->

The more detailed information will be updated soon.
